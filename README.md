# Online-Shopping-Manager

## Description
This project was conceived as part of the coursework for the 1st semester of the 2nd year OOP module at IIT. It aims to oversee the operations of an online shopping system. Employing a console interface, the manager can add, delete, print, and save products to a file. Additionally, a graphical user interface has been integrated, enabling users to browse and select various products, add them to their shopping cart, and view discounted and final prices. The application of OOP principles is evident throughout, facilitating comprehension, while the incorporation of automated testing using JUnit ensures the reliability of all primary methods.
